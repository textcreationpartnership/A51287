is given unto them, as suppose to the Image of God the Father.

    _ XXI. That there is the same reason concerning the Image of Christ.

    _ XXII. That Relative Idolatry is as down-right Idolatry as Relative Adultery and Murder down-right Murder and Adultery.

    _ XXIII. That relative Idolatry is real and proper Idolatry, even according to the nice Notion of the Schools.

    _ XXIV. Whether the doing Divine worship towards the Image of Christ violates the irrepresentableness of the Godhead or no, as also towards the holy Ghosts.

    _ LX. Nor bowing to the name of Iesus.

    _ XLI. Nothing that has the least shew of Idolatry required of our Church, in celebrating the Lords Supper.

    _ XLII. The reason of some mens proneness to adoration of outward objects.

    _ XLIII. The sense of the Church not to be interpreted by the rash expressions of any private Doctour.

    _ XLVI. The harbouring a false Idea of God, horrid and affrightful, another kind of Spiritual Idolatry.

    _ XLVII. That those Christians that persecute and kill one another for conscientious difference in Religion, turn the God of the Christians into a foul Heathen Idol.

    _ XLVIII. The laying out all the strength of our Bodies and Souls, for the satisfaction of our own will, another instance of this Idolatry.

    _ XLIX. The letting out the fulness and entireness of our affection to any Creature, another instance thereof.

    _ L. The making our selves the ultimate end of our actions and services of God, an egregious instance of this spiritual Idolatry.
